#Danish characters on US keyboard
##What is it
If you are from Denmark and have gotten used to the US keyboard, and really really want to use the three important Danish character 'æøå' but you don't want to loose the layout, this script works well for that.

##What it does
This script binds the three danish characters to altgr + their respective position.
More specifically, it binds the characters as following 

```
Right alt + ; gives æ
Right alt + ' gives ø
Right alt + ] gives å
```

And it capitalizes them with the shift button
